    --What are Webpages--
    Webpages, also known as web pages or simply "websites," are documents that contain HTML code
    and can be accessed through a browser. They typically include text, images, links to other websites
    (URLs), and multimedia content such as audio files or videos. The structure of these documents
    is defined by the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which allows users to create and organ
    ize this information in a standardized manner. Each webpage is composed of one main document
