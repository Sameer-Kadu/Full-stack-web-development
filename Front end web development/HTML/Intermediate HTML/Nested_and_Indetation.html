<!-- Nested and Indentation -->

<!-- 
    Nested :
    - A nested element is an element that is contained within another element. In HTML, elements can
    be nested by placing them inside other elements. 
    
    Indentation:
    - The indentation of code in a file refers to the white space or tabs used before lines
    of code to indicate a lower level of nesting. This feature helps developers organize their
    code for readability purposes.
