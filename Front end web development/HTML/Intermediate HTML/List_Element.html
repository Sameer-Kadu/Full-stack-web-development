<h1>Basic Recipe for Making Homemade Noodles</h1>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
<ul>
<li>On a clean surface, create a mound with the flour. Make a well in the center.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the well and add salt if desired.</li>
<li>Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough forms.</li>
<li>Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rest the Dough:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rolling and Cutting:</h3>
<ul>
<li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired thickness. You can use a rolling pin to achieve this.</li>
<li>Once rolled out, use a sharp knife or pasta cutter to cut the dough into your preferred noodle shape and size.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cooking:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
<li>Carefully add the noodles to the boiling water and cook for 2-4 minutes or until they reach your desired level of doneness. Fresh noodles cook much faster than dried ones.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drain and Serve:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once cooked, drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
<li>Serve the noodles with your favorite sauce, broth, or toppings.</li>
</ul>
