lets see how internat works
what is internat? --> internat is nothing but a connection between server and client.
if i have to search for the google.com then first i have to send request to my ISP (internat Service Provider) then ISP will sent this request to the DNS (Domain Name System) and now the
DNS will search for the your requested search and send back the IP address of the request you made and now you can directly connect to the server of the google.com and make interaction.
it is simple as a sending post by a postoffice.

Process:
    Client (you) <---> ISP <---> DNS  
      /|\
       |       
       |
      \|/        
    Server

        Client send request to ISP
        ISP sends the request to DNS
        DNS gives IP address of Server back to ISP
        ISP gives Ip address of server back to client
        Client connects with the server using this ip address

connection:
connection between client to ISP or ISP to DNS or DNS to Server or client to server can be wired connection or wireless connection.

IP address: 
It is an identifier for every device which is connected to the internet. Each computer on the Internet has its own unique IP address, just like each person in the world has a passport
number that identifies them. The Internet uses these numbers to communicate with your PC.

now client can access data available on server.
